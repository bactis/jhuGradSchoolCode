1: write arg parser for it via python module
    a: help DONE
    b: input expected   DONE
    c: optional arguments? starting offset, default 0       DONE
    

2: read in 2 bytes at a time
    a: how to do this in pythonâ€¦. DONE
    b: how to skip bytes
    
3: check if valid/known/supported instruction
    a: have a datastructor of valid ones
    b: fields: name and value
    c: have a function to handle invalid (ask how many bytes to skip?)
        I: non supported instruction detected, try skiping two bytes?


4: instruction length handling
    a: have a datastructor containing the length of it
    b: identify different parts


                -is it known instruction
                    
                -if unknown tell user, ask how to procede

            B: determine length
            ???
        II: if invalid skip 2 bytes



- misc things to keep in mind

-a pointer for current instruction
-a pointer for next instruction

? : some method to display things in a pretty manner
